1)	Developed the app in XML and Java. (as mentioned in the description).
2)	Retrofit is used to call the API data because 
•	It efficiently manages the process of receiving, sending, and creating HTTP requests and responses.
•	Easy to use.
•	Android recommendation.
3)	Database – I used Room Database because It is easily implemented when used to store data locally. Room database provides an easier connection between the database and objects.
4)	Design Choices – Did not have much time to make attractive the app. So I used simple design choices to complete the work efficiently and fastly.
•	I used Constraint Layout in the MainActivity. In which I used TextView, Spinner, Button, and Recycler View (Because it uses less memory to display components means it used only memory which is used to display on the screen, that is why I use Recycler view).
•	Sign Up and Log In – I used the Linear Layout because the design objects need to arrange in linear and vertical order so I used linear layout.


THANKS.
